# MemoryMap

MemoryMap is an interactive application designed to help users understand and visualize how memory allocation works in a computer system. The app allows users to define memory size, specify blocked memory regions, and allocate memory pages dynamically. It provides a graphical representation of free and allocated memory blocks, making it an ideal learning tool for students and enthusiasts of operating systems and memory management.

## Features
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Users can input memory sizes, blocked regions, and page sizes to simulate memory allocation.
Visualization: Displays the allocation results in an intuitive table format, showcasing allocated blocks and free memory spaces.
Interactive Inputs: Provides an easy-to-use interface for configuring memory size, blocked regions, and page sizes.
Real-time Feedback: Instantly updates the memory allocation and free blocks based on user inputs.

## How It Works
Set Memory Size: Define the total memory size available for allocation.
Add Blocked Regions: Specify memory regions that are already in use or blocked.
Allocate Pages: Add page sizes for memory allocation and view how the app fits them into available memory blocks.

## Results:
Allocated memory blocks, showing start and end addresses.
Remaining free memory blocks after allocation.

## Built With
Flutter: The app is developed using Flutter for a smooth and responsive UI.
Dart: The logic for memory allocation and visualization is written in Dart.
